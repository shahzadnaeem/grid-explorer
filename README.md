# Grid Explorer

A React app to play around with CSS grid and it's options

## Instructions

- npm install
- npm start

The app displays one of a number of CSS grids. You can then play with the available grid options to see their effect.

You can find the grid definitions in two places:
- Available selections - `src/App.js`
- Definitions - `src/Components/Grid/Grid.css`.

## TODO

- [x] Add missing grid options - still a few more to add
- [ ] Support flexbox
- [x] Allow picking of just one layout from a drop down for a simpler UI
