# Grid Explorer

A React app to play around with CSS grid and it's options

## Instructions

- npm install
- npm start

The app displays a number of CSS grids that you can find definitions for in `src/Components/Grid/Grid.css`. You can then play with the  grid options that have been added so far to see their effect.

## TODO

- Add missing grid options
- Support grid and flexbox
- Allow picking of just one layout (or maybe 2, side by side) from a drop down for a simpler UI
